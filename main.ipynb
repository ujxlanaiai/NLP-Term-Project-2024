Written consent from the parent(s) is necessary, as it is a legal requirement and demonstrates that they are aware of and agree to the counseling. The child\\'s assent is also important, as it shows that they understand the process and are willing to participate.

The ethical responsibility requires obtaining consent from both the parent(s) and the child, as the child may not fully understand the implications of the therapy. Written consent is typically preferred as it provides a record of the agreement.

The most important factor is obtaining informed consent from the child's parent(s) or guardian.
